# MSCD

The method we proposed is based on the improvement of SRGNN, so some of the model codes are similar to SRGNN and are improved on its basis. 
We make relevant modifications to the SRGNN code under the Recbole framework, so it is necessary to copy SRGNN.py to the corresponding position under the Recbole framework and overwrite it. 
trainer.py and quick_start.py also need to be copied to the corresponding positions and overwritten.
