# MSCD

The method we proposed is based on the improvement of SRGNN, so some of the model codes are similar to SRGNN and are improved on its basis. 
We make relevant modifications to the SRGNN code under the Recbole framework, so it is necessary to copy SRGNN.py to the corresponding position under the Recbole framework and overwrite it. 

trainer.py and quick_start.py need to copy the contents of the file to the corresponding file.

Recently, I discovered some issues during code review. This is mainly because the uploaded code was the initial version and has undergone several modifications since then, 
and the 4090 server previously used to store the code also underwent maintenance. I am currently revising the code. 
Since I have graduated, I will be working on this in my spare time and expect to complete it by the end of December.
